                    <p>Hi there! <br>
                    I'm Kenyada Ijiwoye and I am a Frontend Software Developer! <br>
                    I am profient in HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, and a multitude of web framworks including Bootstrap and Ionic. <br>
                    I also have fundamental working knowledge on Full-Stack Engineering applications such as, Ruby on Rails, LAMP stack, and MEAN stack. <br>
                    I've been designing and programming for over 8 years now with 5 of those years professionally. I have a love for anything tech and internet-related! <br>
                    I am also in the process of renewing my Google Adwords certificate, YES, that means i also do online marketing (3yrs professionally). <br>
                    Hm, what else... <br>
                    Ok well, I'm a self-starter, driven by knowledge and achieving personal, as well as professional accomplishments. <br>
                    In my free time, i enjoy, well... programming of course!! :-) <br>
                    But also I am an avid digital painter, i enjoy music ( i am a musician ;-)), and I love sharing the knowledge I've gained over the years to help others like myself excel in this forever-growing industry. <br>
                    My future plans would include jumping into the world of machine learning and A.I.
