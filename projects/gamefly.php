    <p>So I was online researching info for a new project to work on and somehow landed on <strong>GameFly.com</strong> <br> <br>
    Although everything is organized and simple to navigate, I still wanted to try and see if I can revamp the site and make it look a bit more inviting... Below is the before and after design mockup for gamefly, I decided to go with a darker background to keep focus on the games and threw in a little bit of Google's new "Material Design"(or Google Design) approach... <br> <br>
        <strong>Made with:</strong> Adobe Photoshop CC
